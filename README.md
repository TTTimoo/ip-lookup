# ip-lookup
iplookup, using a api (CHECK SCREENSHOT BELOW!)

(1) First download the files as a zip file.
(2) unzip it
(3) run setup.bat if you don't trust it edit it with notepad++ (it will install the requirements (colorama etc))
(4) run the .exe file. its a exe file because people otherwise people will steal my sourche code and claim it as their own.
(5) Now just enter the ip you want to lookup.
